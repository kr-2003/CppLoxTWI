# CPP Lox TWI(Tree-Walk Interpreter)

## Introduction
This project is a pedagogical implementation of jlox from Part I of Crafting Interpreters, written in C++17. It serves as a C++ alternative to the book's inline Java code, enabling readers to follow along more seamlessly.

Crafting Interpreters is a free, beginner-friendly online guide that walks readers through the process of building a programming language from scratch. jlox is the bookâ€™s implementation of the Lox language using a tree-walking interpreter.

Designed as an educational resource, this project welcomes feedback and suggestions to help identify errors or improve the implementation.
